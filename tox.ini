#### a simple tox.ini
#
# tox (https://tox.readthedocs.io/) is a tool for running tests
# in multiple virtualenvs. This configuration file will run the
# test suite on all supported python versions. To use it, "pip install tox"
# and then run "tox" from this directory.
#
# in _exma_ you have to compile the necesary shared libraries in each
# subdirectory of `exma/` typing `make` in the Linux terminal.
